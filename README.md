## About the App

This is meant to be a simple application demonstarting the use of Java's swing API to create a calculator. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

The main method exists in App.java.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
